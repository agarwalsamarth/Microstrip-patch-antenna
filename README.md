# Microstrip-patch-antenna
## Basic Idea
A patch antenna is a type of radio antenna with a low profile, which can be mounted on a flat surface. Here we have designed a Rectangular Microstrip patch antenna using HFSS software.
ANSYS HFSS is a 3D electromagnetic (EM) simulation software for designing and simulating high-frequency electronic products such as antennas, antenna arrays, RF or microwave components, high-speed interconnects, filters, connectors, IC packages and printed circuit boards.
We have simulated return loss parameter "S11" and VSWR for this antenna. S11 being -14dB.
## How to run
Open the "Mid_Minor.hfss" file through ansys HFSS software and run it.
